# Assignment
Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. You must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

# Solution
The solution uses AJAX to do a get request to GIPHY to pull gifs back based on categories.  The results are displayed dynamically.  Most code is driven by click events.  Attributes in the HTML help drive the logic in the JavaScript.

# Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Bootstrap, Giphy API


# Instructions for Use

This application will search GIPHY.com for gifs that match your search criteria when you click on the search criteria button at the top of the page.

Some search topics have been created for you.  You can also add a new search topic by entering a topic in the input box and clicking "Submit".  This will add a new topic button to the list at the top of the page. Just click your new topic to load gifs.

By default, a still image of the gifs will desplay.  To play the gif, simply click on the image. Click again on a moving gif to stop it.  

The title and rating of each gif will also be included above the gif.
